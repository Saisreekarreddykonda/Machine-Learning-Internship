# 💼 Advanced Machine Learning Projects  
### 🧑‍💻 Internship @ Codveda Technologies

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my Level 3 Machine Learning project portfolio — built during my internship at **Codveda Technologies**. Over the course of this experience, I explored real-world datasets and implemented powerful models using Python, from classic algorithms like Random Forests and SVMs to neural networks with TensorFlow.

All tasks were done using Google Colab + essential data science libraries. This repo captures my end-to-end approach — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

### 🔹 Task 1: Customer Churn Prediction (Random Forest)
- **Dataset**: Telco Customer Churn
- **Goal**: Predict if a customer will churn
- **What I Did**:
  - Cleaned & encoded the data
  - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
  - Evaluated the model using precision, recall, F1-score
  - Visualized top features influencing churn

### 🔹 Task 2: Binary Classification with SVM
- **Dataset**: Iris (focused on 2 classes)
- **Goal**: Classify flower species using Support Vector Machines
- **What I Did**:
  - Trained models with both linear and RBF kernels
  - Visualized decision boundaries
  - Evaluated using accuracy, AUC, precision, recall

### 🔹 Task 3: Handwritten Digit Classification (Neural Network)
- **Dataset**: MNIST (from TensorFlow)
- **Goal**: Build a neural network to recognize digits (0–9)
- **What I Did**:
  - Designed a basic feed-forward NN with Keras
  - Trained using backpropagation
  - Tracked accuracy and loss curves over epochs

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- `Python`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for visualization
- `TensorFlow`, `Keras` for deep learning
